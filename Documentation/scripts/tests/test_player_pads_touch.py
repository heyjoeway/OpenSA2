"""Controllers and touch in the player, end to end without the game.

The player (host/player/player.cpp, "Gamepads") sends SDL's gamepads and its touch overlay
(host/player/touch_overlay.h) to the game as gamepad records on its live input FIFO (contract A
of Documentation/decisions/2026-10-12-S7-all-platforms-by-tuesday.md's push; input.h
send_pads). Here the second host's player, built by host/d3d9gpu/build.sh, plays the synthetic
stream (host/player/synth_stream.cpp) live, as an interactive session does, with
--synthetic-input driving SDL virtual gamepads and pushing finger events, and --input-path a
FIFO this test reads, so each record the game would read is checked byte for byte:

  * pads: a pad attached is slot 0 connected; its buttons by position (SOUTH is A) and D-pad
    are XInput bits, its sticks XInput's (Y up positive), its triggers 0..255; a second pad
    takes slot 1; a pad detached leaves its slot; a press and its release are a record each;
  * touch: the overlay's first touch connects slot 0 (no pad is in it then); a held button
    and the stick are its pad; the stick's origin stays where its finger landed (a finger pulled
    past the radius is a full push, and back where it landed is the centre), and a new touch is
    a new origin; a physical pad given slot 0 shares it with the overlay, and the pad's button
    hides the overlay until the next touch;
  * drawing: --overlay-out's pictures of what the swapchain was given show nothing over the
    frame before the first touch, and the controls after it, in the corners and not in the
    middle;
  * frames: the frames file (read back before Present) holds no overlay: a run without input
    has the same frames table, frame for frame;
  * settings: the same script with SA2_PAD_MAP (a pad's SOUTH and EAST swapped), SA2_TOUCH_MAP
    (the overlay's A sends X) and the overlay bigger with its stick and diamond swapped
    (SA2_TOUCH_SCALE, SA2_TOUCH_LAYOUT) sends the same records with only those buttons changed:
    the script's touches find the controls where the settings put them.

The window opens for a few seconds (the interactive mode refuses a hidden one). The player is
built from this tree by host/d3d9gpu/build.sh (about a minute and a half), unless SA2_PLAYER_GPU
names one already built. test_the_overlay_alone needs neither the player nor its window: it
builds host/player/test_touch_overlay.cpp (the overlay's own pad and drawing, on a Vulkan device)
against the install's SDL3 (SA2_S5_INSTALL, else private/s5-tools/install) and runs it:
