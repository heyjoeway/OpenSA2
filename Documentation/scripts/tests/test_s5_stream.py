"""The S5 Direct3D 9 call stream: its reader, its format, the recorder that writes it,
and the runner that holds a presentation run to the registered replay.

host/sa2_present_rec.c records every call the lifted game makes on the recording
device (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c) into the stream host/sa2_stream.h describes;
tools/s5/stream_dump.py reads it back; tools/s5/present_run.py runs the boot with it
and says whether the guest saw anything different; tools/s5/objcheck.py holds the
recorder's object. All are measuring instruments -- the DXVK player renders what the
stream says, and the presentation run's parity is read through them -- so every
check here has a case that must fail it, down to the comparisons inside each check:

  * the reader, on small streams made here byte by byte: a whole stream reads to
    literal counts; each framing malformation and each content malformation (a blob
    its rule does not give, a Present not followed by its FRAME, a FRAME whose clock
    goes back, each field of a LOCK that is not the lock opened, a lock that lost its
    upload, a shader walk that does not end, pad bytes that are not zero, a blob of no
    role, an object nothing introduced, an entry's argc) is a problem, and under
    SA2_STREAM_DUMP_BREAK naming that check the same stream reads clean. A header
    whose tables are not the shapes the reader indexes is not a stream; a rule or
    entry row that does not read is a problem of that row. Holding a stream to a run
    record: each word of a load's description, the load count, the FILE total, the
    import argc, and the device-log walk's order, `this` and answer.
    Object-producing out parameters are classified by method and success;
    same stream reads clean. Only an out-parameter that answers an object, of a call
    that answered 0, introduces one. The buffer watch recomputed from a stream's own
    records, and held to the counts file's.
  * the format: the rule lines of host/sa2_stream.h equal the table the writer puts
    in a stream's header, both ways, and every method the recording device flags as
    writing through a pointer has a line.
  * the recorder, on the recording device itself with no game
    (tools/s5/tests/rec_harness.c, built with the pinned zig from that file,
    runtime/sa2_d3d9.c and, but for the control, the recorder and the -wrap flags a
    presentation build links it with): the guest sees the same answers, register
    file (the harness's 40-byte stand-in for it, not the runtime's State), function
    table and memory with the recorder on as in a build without it, in every
    scenario; the stream holds each call's arguments and blobs as the harness wrote
    them, a Present's rectangle and region as they were before another thread
    rewrote them inside its wait; every loss is a note, counted. The recorder's
    compile-time breaks each fail the check that names them: REC_BREAK_REGSTORE,
    _FTKIND and _FTNAME move only the register file or the function table, which
    only the harness compares.
  * the recorder's object, compiled as tools/s4/link_s4.py compiles it (the command
    read from link_s4's own compile phase): its undefined symbols are exactly
    objcheck's list, it defines exactly the wraps, every executable section is
    PROGBITS and every branch target, symbol and relocation target in one starts an
    instruction, and it holds no floating point, FP-state or system instruction, no
    SSE instruction outside SIMD_ALLOWED, no double to a variadic call or jump and no
    float conversion in any allocated section; each rule has a compiled falsifier,
    the REC_BREAK_POKE build fails, and the source holds no inline asm.
  * the runner's checks, on small fixtures: each holds on a run equal to the
    registered one and fails when any one of its comparisons fails; the build check
    fails for each way a build is not this tree's or not the binary that ran; READY
    is written only for a stream that holds, with the run's meta, and never while
    another runner holds the trace's lock; a failed run deletes its partial stream;
    --check refuses without a receipt, fails a run whose files are not the tree's,
    fails a trace that is not a stream with a receipt, withdraws READY only from
    a stream that is its own run's, and records whether the run it holds asked for
    audio as that run's meta says, not as --audio does.
    Settings, save reset, stage outputs and input are also held, and a counts file
    with audio is held by audio_counts too (test_s5_audio.py holds the rest of audio).
  * Metal Harbor (unit MH-REC, the end of the file): the calls it makes beyond the
    boot, on the recording device with no game (tools/s5/tests/rec_harness_mh.c):
    vertex buffers locked at an offset and whole and drawn by DrawPrimitive, a
    render-target texture's level and its own depth set as targets, GetBackBuffer,
    GetRenderTarget, GetDepthStencilSurface and D3DXLoadSurfaceFromSurface; the guest
    sees the same with the recorder on; a buffer copied from its store's base
    (REC_BREAK_BUFBASE) and a buffer written after its Unlock (the buffer watch) are
    caught, and a watch that stopped checking (REC_BREAK_NOWATCH) fails the runner's
    stream check. The stream's own counts held to the run's record
    (stream_dump.hold_counts_to_run, its break runcounts), the objects it introduces
    to the ones the device built among them. The runner's stage path:
    tools/s4/stage_run.py's command for the registered observed run under present-mh,
    run_stage's guards, what --check holds of a stage run's files, every stage hook's
    object compiled afresh, the other replay's build names refused, and the buffer
    watch held in the counts check.
