"""Read a device profile exactly as the runtime does, and check a capture's.

Subtitle: parse a sa2-device-profile.txt with runtime/sa2_devprofile.c's
grammar and refusals, word for word, and print what a capture's receipt
records of it.

Why
---
The user ruled on 2026-09-23 that the host's device set is a recorded
property of each capture: the runner records it in the receipt, the lifted
replay reads the same profile back, a run with no capture uses a plain
keyboard-and-mouse default, and a capture whose profile the runtime cannot
reproduce is refused, not approximated. The runtime reads the profile at
configuration and traps on a bad one outside any sa2_call, so the run dies
before the guest starts and the only record is a line on stderr. This reads
the same file the same way first, so the oracle runner can say in the receipt
whether a capture is one the lifted build can replay, and the replay tools
refuse a profile before they link a build.

The grammar, and what the runtime can reproduce, are the comment at the top of
runtime/sa2_devprofile.h; that comment is the one definition, and this file
and runtime/sa2_devprofile.c both follow it. Every refusal below has the C
reader's words, in the C reader's order, and
Documentation/scripts/tests/test_device_profile.py builds the C reader and
holds the two to each other.

The replay tools import this for three more checks: that a capture's receipt
records the profile file that is beside it (`capture_profile`), that a
registered replay's profile is its capture's and every repeat's
(`replay_profile`), and that a lifted run read the profile it was handed
(`check_run`, from crt_probe's `device_profile` block). They also take the
environment a lifted run inherits from here (`clean_environ`), without the
profile and without the host-device overrides, so nothing in a shell decides a
run's devices.

The capture's directory travels with its profile
------------------------------------------------
The game asks the machine where it is as well as what is plugged in: its
current directory (GetCurrentDirectoryA, and every full path GetFullPathNameA
builds from it, CRI's file table among them) and its own file name
(GetModuleFileNameA, and the command line the runtime builds from it). Those
are answers of the capture's machine like the processor count, so a lifted run
that stands for a capture answers the capture's (`guest_paths`: the receipt's
`cwd` and the program its `command` launched, as Wine names them), and a run
that stands for none keeps the runtime's placeholders (`DEFAULT_GUEST`).
`capture_profile` returns them with the profile, `run_env` sets them beside it,
`clean_environ` strips them from a shell, and `check_run` refuses a run whose
own record (crt_probe's `virtual` block) shows another directory than the one
it was handed; `run_guest` is what a run record keeps of it. The tick-380
divergence is why (agents-journals/s4/2026-09-24-tick-380-xeci.md).

The locale travels in the profile too
-------------------------------------
The game's C runtime asks the host for its locale whenever an archive loader
calls setlocale(LC_ALL, ""): the user's LCID, the code pages and the locale
data its category initialisers read. Natively every category qualifies the
user's locale; a runtime that refuses the data leaves three of them in "C". The
profile's optional locale section (`Locale`; runtime/sa2_devprofile.h, "The
locale") carries the native answers, and the probe writes it for every capture,
so a capture taken with the probe in the tree has it (`capture_profile` refuses
one taken with any other). A file without it is the runtime's default locale,
Wine's data for 0x0409 (runtime/sa2_locale.h). SA2_GUEST_LCID and SA2_GUEST_ACP
move that default, so they are host overrides like the processor count:
stripped from a shell, and refused by the runtime beside a profile that records
a locale.

So do the environment block and the standard handles
----------------------------------------------------
The C runtime reads two more host answers at start-up: the environment block
(GetEnvironmentStringsW, from which _environ is built) and the standard handles
with their file types (__ioinit). Each is the capture's process's, so the probe
records them too (`Environment`, `std_handles`; runtime/sa2_devprofile.h, "The
environment" and "The standard handles"): every string of the block at Init and
how many the C runtime's _environ holds, which is the block it saw at start-up
(`Environment.block` is what the runtime answers), and GetStdHandle's three
answers with GetFileType's. A file without them is an empty block and no
standard handles, the default's. SA2_STD_HANDLES=pipe, the replay
configuration's standard handles before profiles recorded them, is a host
override like the rest: stripped from a shell, and refused by the runtime
beside a profile that records the handles.
