"""Sound on the presentation path (S5): the recorder's audio records, the format's audio
lines, the reader that holds a version 2 stream to them and to the audio devices' own
record of the run, and the player's mixer that plays them, held without a GPU, a window,
an audio device or game data. Each is a measuring instrument or feeds one (AGENTS.md rule
5), so every check has a case that must fail it:

  * the reader (tools/s5/stream_dump.py), on small version 2 streams made here byte by
    byte: a whole one reads clean to literal counts; each malformation (an AUDIO record
    in a version 1 stream, a blob its line does not give, a PCM blob of another length,
    bytes outside their buffer's store, a matrix that is not its STATE's, a STATE of
    another object, a re-anchoring call's STATE anchored elsewhere, a submit whose
    frames do not end at its STATE's queued_end, an argc that is not the table's, a call
    on a buffer nothing made, a clock that goes back, a header table that is not the
    format's lines or STATE sizes that are not its structs', an Unlock's store_hash where
    no Lock closed or none where the last did) is a problem, and under the
    SA2_STREAM_DUMP_BREAK naming its check the same stream reads clean; a version 2
    header without its audio table, and a version 1 header with one, are not streams;
    the counts file's per-op counts and store watch are held to the stream's own records;
    and the records and counts are held to the audio devices' own record of the run
    (hold_audio_to_run: a dropped record, a failed call recorded, an answer, an out word,
    a guest thread or a clock that is not the device's, counts that are not its calls,
    and a summary that kept too few records to walk a device's log); the reader's matrix
    bound is the recorder's and the format's.
  * the player's reader (host/player/stream.cpp), through the renderer and a driver
    built here: a version 2 header whose STATE sizes are not the format's, whose audio
    table is not whole, or whose version, schema and audio table disagree is refused
    at open (the renderer exits 3) and at open_live, and the format's own open.
  * the mixer (host/player/mixer.cpp, built here with g++ as sa2_audio_render, the
    renderer host/player/build.sh builds), on literal streams: a 48 kHz buffer plays its
    bytes one frame per output sample and wraps when it loops; one that does not loop
    halts at its end; a 24 kHz one is interpolated halfway between its frames, and so is
    a voice at half rate; mono, 8-bit and float buffers play their frames; volume and pan
    are DirectSound's decibels; a six-channel voice is mixed by its level matrix and runs
    dry at the end of what it was given, and a four-channel one with none plays its first
    two; a cursor, status or voice state the mixer's clock does not give is a problem, so
    are a store that does not hash to the guest's, a store of another length than its
    buffer and a record before the one before it; the WAV is the format it says. Each
    MIXER_BREAK_* build fails the check that names it.
  * the recorder (host/sa2_present_rec.c), on the runtime's own DirectSound and XAudio2
    devices with no game (AUDIO_HARNESS_C below, written out and built with the pinned
    zig from runtime/sa2_d3d9.c, runtime/sa2_dsound.c, runtime/sa2_xaudio2.c and, but for
    the control, the recorder and the -wrap flags a presentation build links it with),
    in two scenarios: the guest sees the same with the recorder off, on, and on with
    SA2_REC_AUDIO=1, every buffer's and voice's record included; without audio the
    stream is version 1 with no audio table, class or count, the same bytes with
    SA2_REC_AUDIO unset and 0; any other value, a break of an audio device's model, and
    an argument count that is not the recorder's (at start-up or at the registration of
    DirectSound's thunks) stop the stream; counting alone counts the calls that failed;
    with audio every record reads clean against the format's lines, the counts file and
    the devices' own record, every PCM blob is the bytes the guest wrote, every STATE the
    device's after the call, every store_hash the guest's store, and the mixer's clock
    gives every cursor and voice state the device gave the guest; a guest write outside
    a Lock is caught by the store watch and, when an Unlock follows, by the mixer.
    REC_BREAK_AUPCM, _AUSTATE, _AUCURSOR, _AUDROP and _AUNOWATCH each fail the check that
    names them, and the recorder's object reaches the audio devices' table getters and
    no cursor helper (tools/s5/objcheck.py).
  * the runner (tools/s5/present_run.py --audio): SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 and nothing else in its
    command, paths of its own, refused with --no-trace, and a stream of the version the
    run asked for from a recorder that wrapped every `audio` line; audio_counts fails on
    each of its terms alone; check_stream, on the harness's streams, fails a stream of
    the version the run did not ask for, and REC_BREAK_AUDROP's on the devices' record
    alone; and stream_dump --run fails that stream the same way.

The registered boot and Metal Harbor runs with SA2_REC_AUDIO=1 are the evidence phase's
(tools/s5/present_run.py --audio); nothing here runs the game.

 * own DirectSound and XAudio2 devices (runtime/sa2_dsound.c, runtime/sa2_xaudio2.c) and
 * the recording device (runtime/sa2_d3d9.c), with no game: made-up calls through the
 * devices' vtables, as lifted code makes them, with Presents between them to move the
 * virtual clock. Documentation/scripts/tests/test_s5_audio.py writes this file, builds
 * it with the pinned zig with and without the recorder and the -Wl,-wrap flags a
 * presentation build links it with, runs it, and holds the guest's view and the stream.
 *
 *   usage: rec_audio_harness --out PATH [--scenario main|extended|unlocks] [--stray] [--late-argc]
 *
 * The runtime pieces the devices and the recorder call -- guest memory, the runtime
 * arena, the guest heap, the function table, the CPU state, the trap, the scheduler's
 * clock and frame hook, the window's numbers, the device profile and the import table
 * -- are stubs below over a host buffer standing for guest addresses 0x00800000 ..
 * 0x04400000, which holds the three literal addresses XAudio2's calls must name
 * (0x01AF0EDC, 0x01AF0EE0, 0x0089E4A8). Every byte handed to a device is made up here.
 *
 * The main scenario: Direct3DCreate9 and CreateDevice; DirectSound's device, its
 * cooperative level, the primary buffer (no format until SetFormat gives it CRI's 48 kHz
 * stereo, played looping), a 4800-byte 48 kHz 16-bit stereo buffer filled through a
 * Lock, retimed to 44100 Hz and played looping; both cursors read; a Lock that wraps,
 * its two segments filled; volume and pan, and a volume the device refuses; a duplicate
 * played once to its end; Stop and SetCurrentPosition; then XAudio2's engine, mastering
 * voice, a six-channel float source voice with its level matrix, two buffers submitted
 * around a Start, GetState, a frequency ratio of 1.25, GetState, Stop, a flush and the
 * teardown. Presents between them advance the clock by 16666 us each.
 *
 * The extended scenario (the paths the main one does not take): the primary again; a
 * 1920-byte buffer duplicated before its first Lock (a store of its own) and after it
 * (sharing its original's); a Lock of the whole buffer (DSBLOCK_ENTIREBUFFER); the
 * shared duplicate locked, written, retimed to 24 kHz, played once to its end, rewound
 * and played again; a Lock from the write cursor that wraps; the buffer retimed to
 * 32 kHz while it plays and back two Presents later; the other duplicate filled, set
 * and played; a refused volume; three buffers submitted, a ratio of 1.5, a flush that
 * keeps the head buffer it had started; and 64 Presents more, so the store watch checks
 * at a FRAME.
 *
 * The unlocks scenario (a live session's store_hash, SA2_REC_STORE_HASH_EVERY): the primary,
 * then one 256-byte buffer locked and unlocked 130 times, a quarter at a time (the k-th Lock,
 * from 1, takes bytes (k - 1) % 4 * 64 to 64 more and writes them with seed k), a Present after
 * every eighth Unlock, and Play.
 *
 * --stray writes two bytes into a store outside any Lock, as a guest could: in the main
 * scenario after the first Unlock (the next Lock and Unlock come after it), in the
 * extended one after the last Unlock of its own-store duplicate (only the watch's FRAME
 * check comes after it), in the unlocks one at byte 200 after the 64th Unlock (the 65th to
 * 67th lock other quarters, and the 68th rewrites it). --late-argc gives IDirectSound8::CreateSoundBuffer two
 * arguments (SA2_DSOUND_BREAK=argc) after the first Present, when the recorder has
 * started and before DirectSound's thunks are registered.
 *
 * --out writes what the guest saw: every call's EAX, how far ESP moved and a digest of
 * the stand-in register file after it; the function table's registrations; a digest of
 * all of guest memory; the devices' own counters and a digest of every buffer's and
 * voice's record; the addresses and answers the test needs to read the stream by; and,
 * as harness/crt_probe.c writes them into a run's record, the two devices' per-method
 * calls and call logs ("run").
