"""Read an S5 Direct3D 9 call stream back, and say whether it is whole and true to
its own rules.

Subtitle: the reference reader of the stream host/sa2_present_rec.c writes and
host/sa2_stream.h describes. It checks the framing record by record, holds every
record's blobs to the rule table the header carries, evaluated here by its own
code, counts records per kind, calls per (interface, slot), entry-point calls per
entry, blobs per role, and frames, and prints any range of records in full. With a
run record it also holds the stream to what the recording device itself recorded.

Framing. A stream is whole when the header reads, every record's `bytes` is a
multiple of 4 and inside the file, `seq` runs 0, 1, 2, ... without a gap, every
SA2S_CALL and SA2S_D3DX is filled exactly by its fields and blobs (each padded to
4 with zero bytes), every SA2S_CALL's argc is the one the header's method table
gives its slot and every SA2S_D3DX's the one its entries table gives, and the last
record is SA2S_END with nothing after it. The header reads when its JSON, its schema
and its tables' shapes do (read_header); a file whose header does not is not a
stream (StreamError), and a rule or entry row that does not read is a problem of
that row.

Content. Every blob's role is one of the six and its arg is one of the call's or
0xFFFF; every record carries exactly the blobs its rule gives for its arguments
and answer, each of the length the rule gives (a shader walked token by token, a
declaration to its end element, a region to its own count); a Present's FRAME is
the next record, a FRAME follows nothing else, and no FRAME's clock or frame count
is below the one before; an Unlock's LOCK describes the lock the reader saw opened
(the Lock's answer, flags and rectangle, the level's shape from the calls that made
it), its bytes are its pitch times its rows whenever those are known (a buffer's,
the size its Lock covers whenever that is known), so an upload the writer could not
copy is a problem whatever the writer noted, and its LOCKED blob is LOCK.bytes long;
every object called, and every object argument that names one, was introduced
earlier in the stream (by an out-parameter that answers an object, OBJECT_OUTS, of a call that
answered 0; CreateDevice's description, a load's description, or Direct3DCreate9's answer).
Given host/sa2_stream.h's text (--format), the header's rule and entry tables must
be its lines, both ways.

Audio (version 2). A version 2 stream is a version 1 stream that may also hold
SA2S_AUDIO records, with schema sa2-d3d9-stream/v2 and an "audio" op table in its
header, whose ds_state_bytes and xa_state_bytes are the two STATE structs' sizes; a
version 1 stream holds none. Every AUDIO record's argc is its op's in that table,
its api is its op's interface's, its blobs are exactly the ones its op's line gives
(each PCM blob the length its arguments, or its XAUDIO2_BUFFER's AudioBytes, say; the
level matrix the bytes its STATE holds; an Unlock's HASH exactly when it leaves no
Lock open on its store), its STATE describes the object the call was on or wrote (a
buffer's, a voice's) and, for a call that re-anchors, is anchored at the call's own
time, a submit's frames end at its STATE's queued_end, every buffer and voice it
calls was introduced earlier by a call that made it, and no AUDIO or FRAME record's
clock is below the timed record's before it. With --format the header's audio table
must be the format's `audio` lines, both ways; with --counts the recorder's per-op
counts must be the stream's, and its store watch's counters the ones the stream's own
Lock, Unlock and FRAME records give; with --run the records, and the counts, are held
to the audio devices' own record of the run (hold_audio_to_run).

The buffer watch. The recorder hashes each buffer's bytes after the Unlock that
closed its last lock (host/sa2_present_rec.c, watch_set and watch_check) and counts
what it did in the counts file's "buffer_watch". The reader recomputes the same
counters from the stream's own Unlock, Lock, Release and FRAME records
(summary["buffer_watch"]), and compare_counts holds the counts file to them, so a
watch that stops checking, or checks less than it says, does not pass.

Anything else is a problem, and a problem is the exit status: this reader is the
instrument the recorder is held to, so it never skips a check quietly. What it
cannot parse it stops at, and says where. A NOTE record is the writer saying it left
something out; the reader counts them and the runner refuses a stream with any.

Usage:
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM               # summary
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM --json OUT    # the summary as JSON
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM --range 200:240   # seq 200..239
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM --counts COUNTS.json
      # hold the stream's per-method, per-entry and Present counts, and the
      # buffer watch recomputed from the stream, to the recorder's own counts
      # file (SA2_REC_COUNTS)
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM --run RUN.json [--imports TABLE.json]
      # hold it to the run's own record: every FILE blob to the recording device's
      # hash of that texture's file, every load's DESC to the device's row, the
      # first calls to the device's call log, each entry's argc to the import
      # table's, and the stream's own counts to the device's (hold_counts_to_run:
      # the calls per method to d3d9.dynamic_surface, the methods called, FRAMEs to
      # the Presents, calls and entry calls to method_calls, each entry's records
      # to its import's calls, and the objects the stream introduces to the
      # objects the device built)
  .venv/bin/python tools/s5/stream_dump.py STREAM --format host/sa2_stream.h
      # hold the header's rule and entry tables to the format's own lines
  (a version 2 stream with --run is also held to the run's audio devices: their
  per-method calls and call logs, and with --counts the recorder's per-op counts)

Exit status: 0 whole (and, with --counts or --run, equal); 1 problems or not a
stream; 2 usage.

SA2_STREAM_DUMP_BREAK=<name> switches one check off, so
Documentation/scripts/tests/test_s5_stream.py can show each check is what fails a
bad stream: seq, end, tail, fill, pad, u64, trunc, argc (framing); rules, frame,
clock, lock, walk, padzero, blobhead, objects, entryargc, table (content); watch (the buffer watch held to counts); runcounts
(the counts held to the run record); aurules, auclock, auobjects, autable, auwatch (the store watch
held to counts), auheld (the audio held to the run record) (audio). Nothing else sets it.
