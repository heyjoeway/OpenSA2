"""The play tweaks: runtime/sa2_tweaks.c's reader and report, the list in runtime/sa2_tweaks.h and
the places each tweak is named, and the first tweak, no-event-bars (runtime/tweaks/no-event-bars.c),
on the events' "shown at 4:3?" answer (0x005F8EC0).

The reader and a tweak's file are built with the pinned zig, as tools/s4/link_s4.py compiles a
runtime source (-O2, x86_64-linux-musl), and linked with a driver that stands in for the lifted
answer and the runtime's peek and register accessors. The stand-in `__real_sub_5f8ec0` does what
the lifted body does: EAX = 1 when ECX is in the game's table of 4:3 events, else 0, then the RET
that pops the return address (ESP + 4). Each call puts a caller's return address at guest [ESP]
first, as the lifted CALL does, so a case reads what each caller would see in EAX.

The list's own tests hold every tweak in SA2_TWEAK_LIST to its runtime/tweaks/<name>.c, or, for a
code-patch tweak (SA2_TWEAK_PATCH_LIST), to its spec tools/s8/variants/tweaks/<name>.json, its line
in the Android settings (GameSettings.TWEAKS) and its line in the release's README, and the
reverse; each tweak file's TWEAK_WRAPS line to the wraps the compiled file defines; the variant
tool's fixtures to no tweak's name; and every link tool's lists to the files
(tools/s4/tweak_sources.py), so a tweak added in one place and not the others fails here by name.
A function the runtime wraps (a tweak's included) is in no runner's wrap list and has no `__wrap_`
in any hook file, and a hook a runtime wrap calls (`sa2_harness_*`) is defined weak and called
there, so a tweak that takes over a runner's wrap and moves the runner's rule into such a hook fails
here, not at link time, when one half is taken without the other.

The reader's code-patch side is compiled from a copy of runtime/sa2_tweaks.h with one code-patch
tweak registered (none is yet), linked with and without a stand-in for the file
tools/s8/variants/variants.py generates; test_variants.py links the generated file itself.

The host side (runtime/sa2_tweaks.h, "Add a host tweak"): the host list (SA2_TWEAK_HOST_LIST) is
held with the game's to one name order and one spelling, each host tweak to its own file in its
home and each file in the homes to its tweak, to the Android switches (but a launcher's) and to the
release's README (but an app's). The game's reader and the host's (host/player/tweaks.cpp, built
with the system g++ as host/player/build.sh builds it) are compiled from a copy of the header with
one host tweak of each home registered (none is yet): the game names each as the host's and turns
nothing on; the host's reader turns on its home's alone, names the others' by home, says nothing of
a game tweak's name, and is off, saying why, out of play and in a replay. Every build of the player
and the launcher compiles the reader and the homes' files.
