// tweaks.h: the host's play tweaks, as the player and the launcher read them.
//
// Subtitle: SA2_TWEAKS names the game's tweaks and the host's alike. runtime/sa2_tweaks.h is the one
// list of both, included here as it is: SA2_TWEAK_LIST, the game's, which runtime/sa2_tweaks.c
// reads in the game, and SA2_TWEAK_HOST_LIST, the host's, whose lines this header makes into the
// host's bits (sa2tw::SA2_TWEAK_<NAME>, its place in that list) and tweaks.cpp reads. Each host tweak
// has a home, where its change is made: "player" (host/player and host/d3d9gpu), "launcher"
// (host/launch) or "app" (the Android app's Java, which asks the settings screen's switch and not
// this reader). runtime/sa2_tweaks.h, "Add a host tweak", has the steps that add one.
//
// The rules, the game's own (runtime/sa2_tweaks.h) as they apply to a host:
//
//   - Play only. A process reads the value once, at its start, and only in play: the player in a
//     play session (--interactive with --input-path, and no synthetic input: not_play below), the
//     launcher outside its selftest and a session it gives the player synthetic input in (both drop
//     the line, for the game and the player too), never either when the game's environment has
//     SA2_REPLAY_TICKS or SA2_REPLAY_WORDS set (off below). That is the game's environment, the one
//     runtime/sa2_tweaks.c asks, not the host's own: the launcher asks the one it gives the game
//     (game.env's lines), and the launcher and the Android session give the player those two
//     settings beside SA2_TWEAKS, so the game, the player and the launcher reach one verdict. Out of
//     play every host tweak is off, and a value that is set is said to be ignored, with why.
//   - One report line, on stderr, whenever the value is set (the launcher's too): the player's
//     "sa2 host tweaks (player): <the reports of its tweaks that are on, or none on> (SA2_TWEAKS=...)".
//     A host tweak of another home is named in it as that home's ("not the player's: ..."). A game
//     tweak's name is the game's, and a name in neither list is the game's to name: runtime/sa2_tweaks.c
//     says so in the game's line, which lists the tweaks there are. A tweak's own lines after it
//     begin "sa2 host tweaks: <report>: ".
//   - Off is the host as it was: each change tests sa2tw::on(its bit) first and otherwise does
//     nothing, so with no value set (and in every replay) the player and the launcher are the
//     builds they were.
//   - By name, never silently: a case a tweak leaves alone, or cannot act on, is said once in its
//     own line.
//
// The value is read as the game reads it: split at commas, each name trimmed of spaces and tabs and
// matched exactly (case counts), a name given twice is one, an empty one is skipped.
